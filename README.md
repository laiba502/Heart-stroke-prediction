# ❤️ Heart Stroke Prediction Project  

This is my **project** where I built a **Machine Learning model** to predict the chances of heart stroke.  
I also created a simple frontend using **Streamlit** for user interaction.  

## 👩‍💻 About Me  
**Created by:** Laiba Farid  

## 📂 Project Files  
- `app.py` → Streamlit app code  
- `columns.pkl` → Saved column transformer  
- `knnheartdisease.pkl` → Trained KNN model  
- `scaler.pkl` → Standard scaler used in preprocessing  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Install requirements using:  
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

## 🌐Live Demo
